        <h3>Tally Hall</h3>
        <p>
            I found Tally Hall when I was in my Junior year of high school through their track "Banana Man" in their first album <i>Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum</i>. "Banana Man" carried two aspects that I would go on to enjoy in Tall Hall's work, namely different sections of each song falling under different genres and image provoking lyrics.
            I loved listening to many of their tracks on their first album, particular favorites are "The Bidding", "Spring and a Storm", and perhaps their most famous song, "Ruler of Everything." Their next album, <i>Good and Evil</i> carried the same elements that I enjoyed from their first album with a slightly darker and ominous feel. 
            It was after I listened to that album that I found out that <b>Tally Hall had disbanded in 2011</b>, nearly 10 years before I discovered them.
            Although most members went down different paths away from music after disbanding, Joe Hawley would continue to write music and would go on to create a new album, <i>Hawaii: Part ii</i> featuring the members of the band the following year after their break up.
            Tally Hall has since <b>wormed</b> its way into the background of many car drives and homework sessions after I first heard "Banana Man" and still makes appearances on occasion in my life.

    <h1>Code Snippet Explination: How to do Logging in Python</h1>
    <p>
        This code snippet describes how to implement basic logging in pyhton. Logging is a brach of coding that tracks what happens as software execute, and track events as they occur.
        Line by line, the first line simply imports the logging library. The second line assigns a name to the logger.
        The next line sets the severity of the logger with DEBUG being on the lowest level and critical being on the highest.
        The formmater is then assigned a Formatter object that expresses the format of the loggers output.
        The next chunk of code assigns a message to file_handler, then sets its level and then format.
        The stream_handler is created in the next line and then is given its nessacary format.
        The last chunk of code adds the file_handler and stream_handler objects to the logger.
    </p>
    <pre>
    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s:%(name)s:%(message)s')

    file_handler = logging.FileHandler('sample.log')
    file_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
    file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    stream_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

    logger.addHandler(file_handler)
    logger.addHandler(stream_handler)
