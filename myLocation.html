        <p>
            My favorite location to visit is a river on my grandpa's property.
             The river funnels through a lake that has been the background to many memories of fishing with my family, as well as the subsequent fish frys on its banks. 
             Some of my most comforting memories were made there and I enjoy my visits when I can make them.

    <p>There are a few places that I want to travel to. Personally, I have never left the United States before and would like to change that. Ideally, I would want to visit the Switzerland, Rome, England, and Cario.</p>
